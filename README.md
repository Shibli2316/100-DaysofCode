# 100-DaysofCode
This is just a small challange for me. The target for this is quite simple and so are the rules. 
-  I have to code for 100 days **straight**.
-  There shoudn't be a gap of **more than 2 consicutive days** at once.
-  If there is a day when I fail to code I won't miss a day for the **next 14 days**.
<p>For this challange i will be coding in various languages learning new concepts and building some projects.</p>
<p>The languages of my choice will be as follows:
  <ol>
    <li>Python with Flask (and Django)</li>
    <li>JavaScript with React JS</li>
    <li>Java along with DSA and Algo</li>
  </ol>
  </p>
This is just to hold myself accountable for 100 days and keep the track for it. Hope I reach the end of it.
My resources are as follows:
<li>Kunal Kishwaha's DSA Bootcamp
<li>30 Days of JavaScript
<li>30 Days of React
<li>30 Days of Python
<li> Angela's Web dev bootcamp
Alongside learning and making projects I will also focus on enhancing my web dev skills. And if time permits I will go for cyber security too. 
<p><em>Let the game begin</em></p>
