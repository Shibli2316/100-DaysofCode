I have started working on react js and on the first day i learned about the file structure and other things. I had a refresher of JSX that is basically HTML that contains java script.
We have to edit the src folder, precisely the app.js file. Rest the folder that has the name public in it is publically accessable so we should avoid keeping any sensitive data in it.
Also we can make components of the page and render it in the app.js page through which the whole website is served hence making it a SIngle Page Application.
